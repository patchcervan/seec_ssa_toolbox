Step selection analysis has become very popular in habitat selection studies that use telemetry data. Habitat selection models are typically framed as spatial point processes, and fitted to spatial observations of an organism. The spatial distribution of these observations is then explained by habitat availability and selection. Habitat availability becomes key in step selection models for temporally-autocorrelated telemetry data, to incorporate movement characteristics of the organism. In this toolbox, we will cover some basic theory underlying step selection analysis to help us dodge some of the common pitfalls. We will then go through a hands-on analysis using the powerful amt R package.
